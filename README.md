# Trigger a page event
  
This site is to demonstrate how a little javascript can trigger a page event when visiting from another page.  You can test this demo by [viewing it live](https://agskryp.github.io/trigger-a-page-event/), and clicking on a link in the drop down menu.  The results will take you to the corresponding page displaying the desired content.</p>
    
Built almost entirely with [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) using their classes and components.  Majority of the components markup is taken directly from their examples.  There are three single pages written completely in HTML, and one line of custom CSS targeting the body background.  The only custom javascript is that to trigger the page events.</p>
